Haskell Torrent - a haskell bittorrent client.
==========

Introduction
----------

This is a Haskell bittorrent client. I am the introduction document
and I need to be written by some generous soul!

Usage
-----------------

We are using cabal for the build. The top-level Makefile will by default
attempt a user install into $HOME by using cabal-install.

Odd bugs
--------

None at the moment.
